  This table contains atmospheric data at constant altitude.  Each row gives  
  characteristics at 110 km inbound altitude for each aerobraking orbit. The  
  values in this table are derived from '100 point running means'. These are  
  99-second running means over the entire aerobraking pass and then           
  interpolated to reference altitudes by doing a least square fit to the      
  reference altitude +- 5 km vs log(density) to obtain density and scale      
  height at the reference altitude (110 km).                                  
  The columns from one to fifteen are separated as follows:  orbit number,    
  UTC time of periapsis, L_s (deg), altitude (km), periapsis altitude (km),   
  latitude (deg), east longitude (deg), local solar time (hr), solar zenith   
  angle (deg), density (kg/km**3), sigma density (kg/km**3), estimated        
  temperature (K), density scale height (km), sigma density scale height (km) 
  and 'rms', the root mean squared of the differences between the least       
  square fit of the densities (+- 5 km from the reference altitude)           
  to the actual (99-second running mean) densities.
